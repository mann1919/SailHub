# SailHub
Android application to help sailing clubs to record and generate results easily.

Sailing clubs traditionally use pen and paper for the recording of race results,
these are then manually typed into SailWave so that the results can be calculated
and published. SailWave is used internationally at all levels of the sport, from
sailing club racing to world championships. This results in a complex software 
as it needs to meet all the requirements.
